# Mason Dizick Public Project Repo

## Est. 2024

### mpdizick@coastal.edu / masondizick@gmail.com

This is a public repo that is intended to host projects deemed ready for public availability.   
The majority of these projects will come from my time learning source control and multiple programming languages at Coastal Carolina University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science.
